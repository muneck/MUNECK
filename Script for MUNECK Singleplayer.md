# Script for MUNECK Singleplayer

## Tutorial Level

**IRIS:** Hello and welcome to the MUNECK Remote Testing Initiative. Because the facility is currently being updated, your return to the office has been postponed indefinitely. However, that should not stop you from carrying science forward via this Remote Testing Initiative.

**IRIS:** You might have forgotten about your neck implant, but we here at MUNECK Technologies have not. As part of a required test protocol, all test subjects implanted with a Neurological Enhancement Cybernetics Kernel should be informed about it regularly and are expected to report any discomfort caused by the implant. In case you are wondering what MUNECK stands for, this is the 12th revision, codenamed μ, of the Neurological Enhancement Cybernetics Kernel, hence the name μNECK, conveniently spelled M-U-N-E-C-K.

**IRIS:** Now let us begin the test proper, shall we? As a friendly reminder, you will move your neck to the rhythm of the music playing in the background. Data packets will appear and fall from the edges of your screen. Your job is to activate these receivers *（点亮 receiver）* and catch these packets in order to gain data. Try it out for yourself, will you?

*（掉下来一个 flick，没接住则继续生成，直到接住为止）*

*（第一次接住了）*  
**IRIS:** Very well. Now let us move on with the tutorial.

*（第一次没接住，接住最后一个音符后）*  
**IRIS:** A bit incompetent, should I say, but I wouldn't worry if I were you. The more you test, the better at this you will get. Now let us move on with the tutorial.

**IRIS:** Apart from what you have just seen, you will also enounter streams of data. You will need to maintain the receiver activated if you want to receive the entirety of its data, and I assume that *is* what you want, isn't it?

*(掉 hold，流程/对白同上)*

**IRIS:** Now for some corrupted data that you **shouldn't** be touching. They almost always come in streams, and touching them will result in an unsatisfactory score as seen on the top right *（点亮右上角分数）*, and more importantly \[garbled\].

*（掉下来一个 avoid）*

*（没接住）*  
**IRIS:** Very well. Note that corrupted data is dangerous and under no circumstances should they be accepted.

*（第一次接住了，避开最后一个音符后）*  
**IRIS:** Haven't I told you why you shouldn't touch theses streams? They *will* \[garbled\], so avoid them as best as you can.

---

**IRIS:** Anyway, let us put all that you have learned into practice, shall we?
